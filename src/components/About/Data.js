    description: 'I initially starting coding in one of my college classes while I was at CSU, I quickly realized how much I love doing it. Since then, I have taken the initiative to learn as much as I possibly could. Outside of school, I have taught myself Python, HTML, CSS, React, and Javascript. While I continue to learn as much as possible, I have taken more time focusing on expanding my knowledge of React. If you would like to know more, feel free to contact me',
